## HealthSense: Disease Forecasting 🧠🩺

**HealthSense** is an AI‑powered web application that predicts multiple diseases based on patient data and symptoms. The system integrates classical Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and a Reinforcement Learning prototype, delivering fast, accurate forecasts and interactive visualizations via a Streamlit interface.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Multi‑Disease Support**: Diabetes, Heart Disease, Lung Cancer, Kidney Disease, Hypertension, Breast Cancer, and more.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Feedforward ANN for tabular data; CNN for imaging data (e.g., lung scans).
- **Reinforcement Learning Prototype**: DQN agent simulating adaptive treatment strategies.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Probability bars, correlation heatmaps, feature distributions, and Plotly charts.
- **User‑Friendly Interface**: Streamlit-based web app for symptom input, live predictions, and result exploration.
- **Modular Codebase**: Clean separation of data, models, notebooks, and application code.
